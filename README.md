# My_Streamlit_Projects

My Project Files where I have:

1. Created a user interface to interact with the ML models using the fantastic library called Streamlit 

2. Saved the entire code as a Docker Image for easy deployment in Docker Hub (Link to the Image is present in the folder)

P.S. : The Docker Image is configured to run on the local host port 8501
